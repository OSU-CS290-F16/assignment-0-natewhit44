		<a name="Assignment_0"><h2>Assignment 0 -- September 24th, 2016</h2></a>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<h3>Challenges, troubles and solutions:</h3>
					<li>
						The only troubles that I ran into were in not understanding
						how to use the git shell commands for windows. After completing
						the <a href="https://try.github.io/">git tutorial</a> linked
						from our README.md file. Once I had completed that walkthrough
						I had all the tools that I needed to add, commit and push
						modifications on the assignment-0 master branch back to github.
					</li> 

					<h3>What was learned and what was already known:</h3>
					<li>
						As stated above, a deeper understanding of the git command line
						tools was gained. Comming into this assignment I have already
						worked with html, css, and some javascript. Additionally I have
						some experience with MySQL. Another thing that I learned while
						completing this assignment was how to interact with the ENGR
						webspace that each engineering student has. This was not
						something that I have ever interacted with before. 
					</li>

					<h3>Resources used to help complete this assignment:</h3>
					<li>
						One of the websites that I have used many time in the past for
						web development guidance and quick tutorials is
						<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools.com</a>. Some
						of the things that were used from this site were information
						about the align attribute as well as size. Another site that was
						used as a reference was
						<a href="http://www.echoecho.com/htmllinks08.htm">echoecho.com</a>,
						from this site the idea of linking to local page locations to help
						quickly navigate to specific assignment's blogs once they start to pile up.
					</li>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<h3>Problems encountered in assignment 1:</h3>
					<li>
						This assingment was pretty straigt forward. The main thing that helped
						me when I was developing the style.css file for this assingment was looking
						through the DOM outline for the index.html file. By utilizeing the Chrome
						browsers inspection tool I was able to easily identify classes which were made,
						as well as gain a more sound understanding of the tag structure of the html.
						Once you know how the site is layed out it is much easier to appy CSS rules.

						<br>
						
						One of the major problems that I ran into during this assignment was a general
						lack of understanding of the difference between different CSS position values
						(ie. static, absolute, fixed, relative, etc.). By experimenting with different
						positioning values I was able to gain a more fundamental understanding of how each
						value affects the object of focus.
					</li> 

					<h3>What was learned and what was already known:</h3>
					<li>
						Before starting this assignment there were three seperate instances where I worked
						on the development of a function stylesheet for a website. Each of these occurances
						have been on working for a web site for someone close to me or a business/local 
						non-profit which have needed help setting up a web site. Since CSS relies mostly
						on html object specification and rules which alter the style of the web site
						output, it is not a complicated language to understand.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		<a name="Assignment_2"><h2>Assignment 2</h2></a>
		<p>
				<ul>
					<h3>Problems encountered in assignment 2:</h3>
					<li>
						The main problem that I ran into while working through this assignment was that
						I was not very experienced with javascript. When I was working through the event
						handler which provided the interaction for the Add ToDo note, I had a rough time
						geting the all of the elements which composed a stick note into a correct final
						form. But after a bit of reading I was able to just think about which elements needed
						nested in which divs, then treat it like a flow layout that stacks each component on
						the other. Once each of the notes divs were set up, I just appended then as child
						nodes of the section container which acted as the note background.

						<br>

						Another thing that I had an issue with was getting a dismiss symbol on the new
						notes in the same method that the manually set set up ones were. I first tried
						to create a text node with had the string, '& times;' -> &times;. As you can see
						the problem is that the text node displays the content as text and does not 
						call the times symbol. In order to get around this I chose to use the innerHTML
						function to insert the characters in a format where it would display as a symbol.			
					</li> 

					<h3>What was learned and what was already known:</h3>
					<li>
						In the past I have created two versions of a website for a local community garden,
						the first was done from the ground up and the second was done in Wordpress. The
						reason that I also created a Wordpress site was in hope to provided a more userfriendly
						means of others appending content and managing the layout. It turned out that the 
						Wordpress interface was still to complex for the users to add content to the site
						so I eventually stopped paying attention to managing content. During that experience
						I was exposed to HTML, CSS, and some javascript. This assignment helped me to learn
						more about isolating elements through a number of methods as well as how to add
						interactivity to objects on the page. This is very exciting because I just got
						put on a team at HP that builds in house web applications for engineers and chemists
						so that they can easily visual print performance data and/or data on the physical
						properties. I am looking forward to working with my team on the final project as well
						as getting into the backend portion of the class.
