					<h3>Challenges, troubles and solutions:</h3>
					<li>The only troubles that I ran into were in not understanding how to use the git shell commands for windows. After completing the <a href="https://try.github.io/">git tutorial</a> linked from our README.md file. Once I had completed that walkthrough I had all the tools that I needed to add, commit and push modifications on the assignment-0 master branch back to github.</li> 
					<h3>What was learned and what was already known:</h3>
					<li>As stated above, a deeper understanding of the git command line tools was gained. Comming into this assignment I have already worked with html, css, and some javascript. Additionally I have some experience with MySQL. Another thing that I learned while completing this assignment was how to interact with the ENGR webspace that each engineering student has. This was not something that I have ever interacted with before. 
					</li>
					<h3>Resources used to help complete this assignment:</h3>
					<li>One of the websites that I have used many time in the past for web development guidance and quick tutorials is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools.com</a>. Some of the things that were used from this site were information about the align attribute as well as size. Another site that was used as a reference was <a href="http://www.echoecho.com/htmllinks08.htm">echoecho.com</a>, from this site the idea of linking to local page locations to help quickly navigate to specific assignment's blogs once they start to pile up.
